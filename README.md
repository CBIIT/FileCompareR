# FileCompareR
This script takes two data files (.tsv, .csv, .xlsx), a clinical and a metadata file in most cases, and compares two selected columns.

To run the script on a CDS v1.3.1 template, run the following command in a terminal where R is installed for help.

```
Rscript --vanilla FileCompareR.R --help
```

```
